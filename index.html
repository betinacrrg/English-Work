                The history of Hawaii began with the discovery and settlement of the Hawaiian Islands by Polynesian people between 940 and 1200 AD.  The first recorded and sustained contact with Europeans occurred by chance when British explorer James Cook sighted the islands in January 1778 during his third voyage of exploration. In Hawaii, the money that they use is the American Dollar and the Hawaiian culture is a blend of Polynesian traditions, Native Hawaiian beliefs and influences from other ethnic groups. About the Traditional Food, "Poi" is a staple of local cuisine, made from Taro root. Also, Poke is a popular Hawaiian dish of marinated raw fish served with vegetables, rice and other ingredients. In Hawaii, you can enjoy iconic activities, like: Snorkeling and surfing at Waikiki Beach, exploring the historic Pearl Harbor National Memorial, hiking Diamond Head State Monument, etc.
